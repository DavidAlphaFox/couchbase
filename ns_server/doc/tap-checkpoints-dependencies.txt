ns_server depends on tap checkpoints in a number of places. Here's
full list:

* ebucketmigrator asks downstream bucket about it's closed checkpoints
  and passes them with tap connect command to upstream bucket. tap connect needs them.

* ebucketmigrator queries checkpoints of source node as well to avoid
  replicating from vbuckets with open checkpoint zero. Which may
  happen in chain where first replica is not yet ready to replicate
  stuff into second replica due to not yet completed backfill into
  first replica.

* same thing is done with change_vbucket_filter command. change_vbucket_filter needs them.

* ebucketmigrator is tracking tap backfill completion message that
  flows through it. This is done to detect end bulk data
  transfer. When we see backfill completion (or other messages that
  signal that backfill is not happening) we allow other vbuckets
  movements to/from source and destination nodes

* as part of replica building phase we're querying open checkpoints at
  all replica building destinations to make sure they all have same
  open checkpoint. This is done in order to prevent attempts to
  chain-replicate from replica that's slightly behind into second
  replica that's slightly ahead which would cause backfill.

* checkpoints, particularly forced checkpoint creation command and
  wait for checkpoint persistence command are used to ensure that
  future master's indexable db state is not behind current
  masters. We're also using this facility to ensure that future master
  is "resonably close" w.r.t. persisted data compared to current
  master. I.e. so that not too much data can be lost if we lose power
  shortly after vbucket move.

* forced checkpoint creation and wait for checkpoint persistence are
  used to "checkpoint" xdcr progress

* checkpoint and tap stats are logged periodically during rebalance as
  a diagnostics
