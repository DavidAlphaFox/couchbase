Forcing streaming bucket info to be streaming terse bucket info for perf and fun
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 2.5.0 you can do:

# wget -O- --post-data='ns_config:set(send_terse_streaming_buckets, true)'. http://Administrator:password@127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval

This will cause the following urls
/pools/default/bucketsStreaming/:bucket to be serving same info as
/pools/default/bs/:bucket (aka streaming terse bucket info)

Why ?

Serving tens of thousands concurrent requests for terse bucket info is
possible for terse bucket info requests (due to heavy caching and
right handling of fan-out of same into to lots of connections). The
same cannot be said for normal bucket infos (at least as implemented
now, some very similar treatment is possible but was not implemented).

Terse bucket infos do not have some attributes from bucket infos. So
some SDKs might not like lack of attributes they used to see. Ideally
we'd always serve terse bucket infos but we cannot due to possibility
of older clients not digesting terse bucket infos.

So for cases where:

a) you know you have sdk library that works with terse bucket infos

b) you're desperate enough to try less tested code path

we've implemented that setting.

Note that, this setting _only_ applies to streaming buckets url. So it
will not affect xdcr or UI or testrunner. This url is only used by
smart clients and per-bucket or standalone moxi (not our "default"
moxi).
