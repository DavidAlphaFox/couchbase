Simple golang implementation of du
==================================

Erlang is too slow at walking directories and computing their
aggregate size. This is simple implementation that speeds it up.

You normally don't need to rebuild anything here. I expect this
program to change very infrequently. So we're keeping produced
executables (and go produces easily usable static executables) in
git. Simple cross-compilation and static executables are reason why
I've chosen golang for this.

If you need to build anything, use build-stuff.sh script. But you'll
need to setup your go toolchain for cross-compilation.

I've followed instructions at to setup go toolchain for
cross-compilation
